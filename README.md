## About This Project

- **Summary:** This project is a clone of the home page of the English language version of the Mexico tourism website and is an example of *responsive web design*. The author took certain a limited number of liberties with the content and formatting.
- **Project Feature 1:** The **navbar is responsive** and fixed at the top of the page.  When the screen is small, the navbar is accessible through a dropdown menu. 
- **Project Feature 2:** The **Bootstrap v5.2 carousel** feature is used in two places:  [1] for the weather widget feature that shows weather in various locations throughout Mexico, and [2] for the Mexico trivia portion of the website.  The carousel is set up such that the user can use the directional controls to navigate both forward and backward through the content endlessly.  
- **Project Feature 3:**  During the course of this project, more was learned about **responsive sizing of fonts**.  To assist with the use of rem units, the default font size of the document was set to 10px such that 1rem = 10px, 1.1 rem = 11px and so forth.  Additionally, the author was introduced to the *calc* function and made use of that in some locations, particularly later on in the code.
- **Project Feature 4:** Certain elements of this project make use of **absolute and relative positioning**. Those, along with **z-index** settings, were used to create **overlay effects**.  While overlays are used in several places, the *hero* section is the most obvious.

**Note About Images and Video Used** *All images and video on this website were created using www.canva.com with the exception of official logos, the geometric svg file used as background in a few locations, and the colorful divider image.  Logos were sourced either from https://www.visitmexico.com/en/ or from the internet.*

**Disclaimer:**  *There is a small amount of JavaScript styling in the HTML document used to create a hover over pop-up message warning users that if they click on the weather widget they will be taken to an external website. Since developing weather widgets requires the use of JavaScript, and since the author had not yet learned this skill, the weather widgets were sourced from the website www.booked.net.*
